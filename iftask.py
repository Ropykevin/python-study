# Simple Questions:
#  1.Given a variable temperature with a value of 25째C, write an if statement to check if the temperature is above 30째C using the greater than (>) operator.
#  2.	Create a dictionary called stock with items as keys and their quantities as values. Write an if-else statement to check if the quantity of "apples" is zero using the equality (==) operator. 
# 3.	Declare a list called even_numbers containing integers. Write an if statement to check if the first element of the
temperature = 25
if temperature >30:
    print('temperature is above 30째C')
else:
    print("temperature is below 30째C")

#  2.Create a dictionary called stock with items as keys and their quantities as values. Write an if-else statement to check if the quantity of "apples" is zero using the equality (==) operator. 
stock= {
    "apples":0,

    "bananas":35
}

if stock["apples"]==0:
    print("apple quantity is 0")
else:
    print("apples quantity is greater than 0") 

# 3.Declare a list called even_numbers containing integers. Write an if statement to check if the first element of the
#  the list is an even number using the modulo (%) operator 

even_numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,7,8,9,]
if even_numbers[0]%2==0:
    print("number is even")
else:
    print("number is not even")

# 4. Given a list prices containing prices of products, write a code snippet using 
# if statements to check if any product's price is within the range $20 to $50 using the 
# logical and operator.

# Imagine you have a list employees containing dictionaries with keys

# 5.	Create a dictionary book_ratings with book titles as keys and their ratings as values. 
# Write an if-elif-else statement to find out if a book "The Adventure" 
# has a rating of 5 or is rated below 2.

# Suppose you have two sets: set_x and set_y.
# Write a code snippet using conditional statements to check 
# if the symmetric difference between the two sets is not empty, using the ^ 
# (symmetric difference) operator
